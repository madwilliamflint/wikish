Right now I'm using get requests for everything.  That's really stupid. But it works.

I think this is as simple as:

-  changing the template form action to post
-  changing the bottle route method in the save route to post
-  changing the retrieval of the content form variable to use the post method (bottle specific change.)

SHOULD be done. I'll know when I hit save on this....page.

Yep! *\o/*
